# Home of the AQUAPI project #

Yet another fun playground IOT project where the aim is to explore the RaspberryPI with a TFT hat, camera and other stuff as well as work with a few sensor connected to a Arduino UNO. Sensor data - and other stuff - will be sent to the cloud for processing. Exploring cloud services such as storage, analytics, realtime messaging ... and where ever the force leads us.

## The hardware set-up ##
### Raspberry PI ###
* 3 w/ on-board camera
* 2.2 PiTTF hat from Adafruit
### Arduino Uno ###
* PIR Sensor
* DS18B20 for water temperature
* BME280 for air temp, pressure, humidity
* Photo resistor
* TSL2561 for external light
* Funduino water sensor
  
## The software setup ##
* Nodejs
* Johnny-five
* Amazon Elastic services
* Amazon S3
